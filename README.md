# datainconflict
Project still under development, developed as Data In Conflict class at ITP/NYU. It's a search engine tool that scrapes articles from different brazilian newspaper and "normalize" its visuals â€“ giving the user the chance of informing with no initial labels but once you read the full article you can see who wrote / who published and evaluate how aligned you felt with it.
